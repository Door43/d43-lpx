Then Jesus went throughout the region of Galilee, and large crowds came to him. They brought many people who were sick or handicapped, including those who could not see, walk, hear, or speak, and Jesus healed them.

Many people who had demons in them were brought to Jesus. At Jesus’ command, the demons came out of the people, and often shouted, “You are the Son of God!” The crowds of people were amazed and worshiped God.
