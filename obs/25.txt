Jesus replied, “It is written in God’s word, ‘People do not only need bread in order to live, but they need every word that God speaks!’”

Then Satan took Jesus to the highest point on the Temple and said, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, because it is written, ‘God will command his angels to carry you so your foot does not hit a stone.’”

But Jesus replied to Satan by quoting from the Scriptures. He said, “In God’s Word, he commands his people, ‘Do not test the Lord your God.’”

Jesus replied, “Get away from me, Satan! In God’s word he commands his people, ‘Worship only the Lord your God and only serve him.’”

Jesus did not give in to Satan’s temptations, so Satan left him. Then angels came and took care of Jesus.
