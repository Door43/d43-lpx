One day while Moses was taking care of his sheep, he saw a bush that was on fire. But the bush did not burn up. Moses went towards the bush to be able to see it better. As he approached the burning bush, the voice of God said, “Moses, take off your shoes. You are standing on holy ground.”

God said, “I have seen the suffering of my people. I will send you to Pharaoh so that you can bring the Israelites out of their slavery in Egypt. I will give them the land of Canaan, the land I promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.”

Moses asked, “What if the people want to know who sent me, what should I say?” God said, “I AM WHO I AM. Tell them, ‘I AM has sent me to you.’ Also tell them, ‘I am Yahweh, the God of your ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.’ This is my name forever.”

Moses was afraid and did not want to go to Pharaoh because he thought he could not speak well, so God sent Moses’ brother, Aaron, to help him. God warned Moses and Aaron that Pharaoh would be stubborn.
