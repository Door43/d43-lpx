The people were very afraid and asked Jesus to leave. So Jesus got into the boat and prepared to leave. The man who used to have the demons begged to go along with Jesus.

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-32-11.jpg?direct&}}

But Jesus said to him, “No, I want you to go home and tell your friends and family about everything that God has done for you and how he has had mercy on you.”

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-32-12.jpg?direct&}}

So the man went away and told everyone about what Jesus had done for him. Everyone who heard his story was filled with wonder and amazement.

Jesus returned to the other side of the lake. After he arrived there, a large crowd gathered around him and pressed in on him. In the crowd was a woman who had suffered from a bleeding problem for twelve years. She had paid all of her money to doctors so they would heal her, but she only got worse.

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-32-14.jpg?direct&}}

She had heard that Jesus had healed many sick people and thought, “I’m sure that if I can just touch Jesus’ clothes, then I will be healed, too!” So she came up behind Jesus and touched his clothes. As soon as she touched them, the bleeding stopped!
