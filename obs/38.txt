After Judas took the bread, Satan entered into him. Judas left and went to help the Jewish leaders arrest Jesus. It was nighttime.

After the meal, Jesus and his disciples walked to the Mount of Olives. Jesus said, “You will all abandon me tonight. It is written, ‘I will strike the shepherd and all the sheep will be scattered.’”

Peter replied, “Even if all the others abandon you, I will not!” Then Jesus said to Peter, “Satan wants to have all of you, but I have prayed for you, Peter, that your faith will not fail. Even so, tonight, before the rooster crows, you will deny three times that you even know me.”



{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-38-10.jpg}}

Peter then said to Jesus, “Even if I must die, I will never deny you!” All the other disciples said the same thing.

Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane. Jesus told his disciples to pray that they would not enter into temptation. Then Jesus went to pray by himself.

Jesus prayed three times, “My Father, if it is possible, please let me not have to drink this cup of suffering. But if there is no other way for people’s sins to be forgiven, then let your will be done.” Jesus was very troubled and his sweat was like drops of blood. God sent an angel to strengthen him.

After each time of prayer, Jesus came back to his disciples, but they were asleep. When he returned the third time, Jesus said, “Wake up! My betrayer is here.”

Judas came with the Jewish leaders, soldiers, and a large crowd. They were carrying swords and clubs. Judas came to Jesus and said, “Greetings, Teacher,” and kissed him. This was the sign for the Jewish leaders to know whom to arrest. Then Jesus said, “Judas, do you betray me with a kiss?”

As the soldiers arrested Jesus, Peter pulled out his sword and cut off the ear of a servant of the high priest. Jesus said, “Put the sword away! I could ask the Father for an army of angels to defend me. But I must obey my Father.” Then Jesus healed the man’s ear. After Jesus was arrested, all the disciples ran away.
