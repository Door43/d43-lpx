The next day, Jesus came to be baptized by John. When John saw him, he said, “Look! There is the Lamb of God who will take away the sin of the world.”

John said to Jesus, “I am not worthy to baptize you. You should baptize me instead.” But Jesus said, “You should baptize me, because it is the right thing to do.” So John baptized him, even though Jesus had never sinned.

When Jesus came up out of the water after being baptized, the Spirit of God appeared in the form of a dove and came down and rested on him. At the same time, God’s voice spoke from heaven, saying, “You are my Son whom I love, and I am very pleased with you.”

God had told John, “The Holy Spirit will come down and rest on someone you baptize. That person is the Son of God.” There is only one God. But when John baptized Jesus, he heard God the Father speak, saw God the Son, who is Jesus, and he saw the Holy Spirit.
