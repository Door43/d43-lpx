“But when the mustard seed grows, it becomes the largest of all of the garden plants, big enough that even the birds come and rest in its branches.”

“The kingdom of God is also like treasure that someone hid in a field. Another man found the treasure and then buried it again. He was so filled with joy that he went and sold everything he had and used the money to buy that field.”

“The kingdom of God is also like a perfect pearl of great value. When a pearl merchant found it, he sold all that he had and used the money to buy it.”

Ette Yesu ŋelimak hiyebi to lomuk huwo ille erruk hijo obis hiroo innohosiehosi ojo omiana lomuk huwo. Ojo inyeja, ”Huwo ohorik ofwo ahajii imojit omojori. Lobo lohosie ara hamojoni ho musuru, ojo lobo ara hetidihitani to klesia.”

“The religious leader prayed like this, ‘Thank you, God, that I am not a sinner like other men—such as robbers, unjust men, adulterers, or even like that tax collector.’”

“‘For example, I fast two times every week and I give you ten percent of all the money and goods that I receive.’”

“But the tax collector stood far away from the religious leader, and did not even look up to heaven. Instead, he pounded on his chest with his fist and prayed, ‘God, please be merciful to me because I am a sinner.’”

Then Jesus said, “I tell you the truth, God heard the tax collector’s prayer and declared him to be righteous. But he did not like the religious leader’s prayer. God will humble everyone who is proud, and he will lift up whoever humbles himself.”
